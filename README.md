# Movies-Extract, Transform, Load

# Overview
Create an ETL pipeline from raw data to a SQL database.  Amazing Prime wants to develop an algorithm to predict which low budget movies will become popular so they can buy the streaming rights for those movies.  To have some fun and connect with the local coding community, Amazing Prime is sponsering a hackathon where the goal is to create their prediction algorithm using a clean database of movies we will create.  We are tasked with automating the ETL process by creating one function to extract multiple data sets from Wikipedia and Kaggle, transform the data sets and clean out any null or unwanted data and then combine these data sets into a workable formand load them into a SQL database.
